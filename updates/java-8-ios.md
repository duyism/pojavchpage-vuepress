# OpenJDK 8 is coming to iOS

So we fumbled around for a while and then ended up asking for help. Armed with the source code Azul released for their OpenJDK 8 port to Apple Silicon Macs, we were able to patch and run Java 8 without too many issues on iOS! With OpenJDK 8, we can finally run older versions of Forge and Fabric without immediately crashing or hanging, and support for 1.5.2 and lower versions are currently in the works. This is one of the biggest changes we've ever made to PojavLauncher on iOS. Support for Java 8 is natively available as of commit [f7c9ec5](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher_iOS/commit/f7c9ec5695a2f5bde8b6910b32f3b57ce6a76280), and `pojavlauncher-dev 1.3~alpha35`.
