## Contributing to the launchers

PojavLauncher is completely open source, so we're happy to accept your contributions to our launcher repositories, whether it be code or not. Here's some things to do for contributions:

* Submit your changes through a pull request and be descriptive about what changed. This makes our jobs easier by helping us figure out what changed quicker.

* Try not to lump multiple, unrelated changes into one pull. This can make it harder for us to review the code or cause a situation where nothing too productive *actually* changed. If you're going to make multiple, unrelated changes, try seeing what can be grouped with another, and submit multiple pull requests instead.

* Be flexible and ready to change your code if required. We recommend keeping your fork healthy and up to date by creating pull requests on your repository (from PojavLauncherTeam to your fork) to grab the latest changes.

The following should help decipher how PojavLauncher works.

### iOS

* Uses OpenJDK 16 from Procursus to get a real Java environment
