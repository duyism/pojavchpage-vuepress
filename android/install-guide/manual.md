# Getting PojavLauncher from the GitHub repository

* Select a Release (Latest verified (✔️) release preferred)

* Scroll Down and click `assets`

* Click to either `app-debug.apk` or `app-noruntime-apk`
## How to install (ACTIONS) ?

* Make sure you're signed into GitHub

* Link to the action builds can be found [here](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/actions)

* Select an action with a green check (✔️,approved)

* Scroll down until you find Artifacts

* Then select between `app-debug.apk` and `app-noruntime-debug.apk`


## Selecting Between `app-debug.apk` and `app-noruntime-debug.apk`


### APP-DEBUG

* Java 8 is packaged inside (no need to install runtime)


### APP-NORUNTIME-DEBUG

* Java Runtime needs to be selected after launching the app for the first time

**Update:** Java Runtime Manager allows you to install multiple Java versions. (So the choice doesn’t matter)
