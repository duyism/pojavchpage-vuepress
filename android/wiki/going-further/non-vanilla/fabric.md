 
# Installing Fabric on PojavLauncher (Android)


## *Fabric is a lightweight, experimental modding toolchain for Minecraft. It allows you to load many optimizing mods you definitely don't see on forge!*


## What is fabric ? What does it do ?

* Fabric is a lightweight modloader like forge, but different.

* It is mostly used for mods like
[Sodium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sodium), mod that optimizes the game like Optifine, [lazydfu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lazydfu), an optimization mod that makes the initialization of DataFixerUpper "lazy", hacked clients like [wurst](https://www.wurstclient.net/) and much more!

## How to get it on my Android device ?

### We will be using [fabric-installer](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-installer), a tool for creating Fabric-ready profiles for the official Minecraft launcher.


* Installations can be found [here](https://fabricmc.net/use/) (Official) 

  * Press the `Download installer (Universal/.JAR)` and download from there, otherwise you can't get it to work on PojavLauncher

* Open PojavLauncher

  * Press `Options`

  * Then `Launch a mod installer (Forge, LabyMod, Fabric, etc.. )`

  * And select the `fabric-installer-{version}.jar` 

* Wait a little bit (shouldn't take so long, depending on the device)

* Close the log by pressing ‚ùå icon

* Select the Minecraft version you want fabric to be installed on

* And press install

  * It will lag a bit, but when it says `Fabric loader {version} for {Minecraft version} has been successfully installed`, you can close the app via `force close` or just closing the app from recents and launching again.

* Tada! Fabric has been successfully installed to your device, you can open up PojavLauncher and select it from versions list to start it!
