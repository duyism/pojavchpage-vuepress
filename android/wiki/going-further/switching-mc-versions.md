 # Switching between Minecraft Versions
Just like the official launcher, or tLauncher, PojavLauncher also enables you to switch between minecraft versions.

### â€¢ How do i play another minecraft version than just the version i'm playing? 
* NOTE: (ENABLE WIFI/DATA FIRST TO CHECK AND INSTALL FOR VERSION)


First, scroll down, then tap your desired version that you wanna play.
Next, tap the 'PLAY' tab. It will install the corresponding version.

***Do note that:***
| Skip | No-Skip |
|---|---|
| Skips the resource downloading (No music, Gray title screen.) | Downloads everything. |

Wait for it to download. After that, when you got into the title screen, turn off the wifi/data.

Have fun playing ~~with Herobrine~~ with some old and new Minecraft Versions there!
