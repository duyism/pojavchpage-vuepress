# Getting PojavLauncher with Procursus

#### You have Procursus if you use Chimera, Odyssey, Taurine, or another jailbreak that comes with libhooker.

Thanks to [@Diatrus](https://twitter.com/diatrus), PojavLauncher is now available on Procursus. To get started with PojavLauncher on one of these jailbreaks, follow the simple steps:

1. Open a package manager of your choice.
2. Search for `pojavlauncher`.
3. Download and install "PojavLauncher iOS".

Everything will be installed for you. The dependency--**openjdk-16-jre**--simply includes the Java 16 package, required to run Minecraft.
