# Signing in

Since Minecraft: Java Edition has many account types, you'll need to figure out which option to select.

**Mojang Login** allows you to sign into legacy Minecraft Premium or Mojang accounts. You have full access to all of Java Edition with this account, because you purchased the game.
* Minecraft Premium accounts still use *usernames* to sign in.
* Mojang accounts use *emails* to sign in.

**Microsoft Login** allows you to authenticate with your Microsoft account to sign into Minecraft. This option may be a little finnicky as the Microsoft account migration hasn't started. You may not be able to join servers using a Microsoft account just yet, but if it works successfully you have full access to all of Java Edition with these accounts, because you purchased the game.

~~**Offline Login** allows you to use a cracked Minecraft account to sign in. You won't be able to join servers unless their option for online-mode is set to false, as these accounts are not "legit" to Mojang's authentication servers.~~ (This option is being replaced by `Local mode`.)

**Local Account** allows you to use an offline Minecraft account to sign in. It’s like an offline account, but you can not download Minecraft from Mojang’s servers.
