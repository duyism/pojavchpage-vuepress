# Improving performance

Minecraft is a lot more fun to play when you're sitting at more than 1-8 FPS, which is common for older devices. This page will show you how you can improve your gameplay performance and experience.
 
## Method 1: Messing around with Java arguments

See the [Custom Java arguments](java-arguments) page for more information.

## Method 2: PojavOptimize

Originally made to help his OnePlus 6T, PojavLauncher Discord moderator Chuck_Norris_ has made PojavOptimize, a collection of Fabric mods to boost performance. With slight modifications, it is now hosted on Doregon's Cydia Repository. Same of the mods included are:

* Sodium, a new rendering engine.
* Starlight, a rework of the light engine.
* FerriteCore, to reduce memory usage.
* Smoothboot, to reduce the load times for lower-end devices.
* OKZoomer, for OptiFine zoom controls.
* NotEnoughCrashes, to report more details on crash logs and allow you to keep playing.

You can find it in the "Games" section of Doregon's Cydia Repository. It will be periodically updated with new mod and game versions. **Note that you must have a version of Fabric installed according to the version of PojavOptimize!** So if PojavOptimize is version 1.16.5-2, you need Fabric 1.16.5 to use PojavOptimize. **Forge will also not work with PojavOptimize's /mods and /config folders, because Fabric.** To get around this, you can either uninstall PojavOptimize or rename each folder to /mods.bak and /config.bak.
