# How do I use the controls?

Each button you see on the GUI has a purpose. Let's go through the buttons from top to bottom:

* The touch screen emulates a mouse. It's exactly like enabling Split controls in Bedrock Edition. However, when grabbing items from your inventory you may find that you need to double-tap or long press. To scroll, hold down the scroll bar and drag.

* `Debug` opens the F3 menu, revealing information about FPS, Minecraft version and loader type, and memory. Change the Video Settings > Other > Reduced Debug Info value to Off to reveal even more information about your instance.  

* `Chat` opens the chat window.

* `Keyboard` opens a keyboard. None of the keys on the virtual keyboard are registered in-game and only work with text entry.

* `Tab` presses the Tab key for autocompletion or switching text entry focus.

* `Opti-Zoom` enables you to use OptiFine's zoom feature. This button also works for OKZoomer.

* `Off-hand` switches the currently selected hotbar item to your other hand.

* `3rd` switches the camera view position.

* The D-pad acts as WASD and the diamond in the center acts as shift to sneak. The black square on the right acts as space to jump.

* `Pri` emulates the primary mouse button to break and hit. Likewise, `Sec` emulates the secondary mouse button to use items or block.

* `GUI` turns all of the visible buttons off (except for the GUI button). Useful for screenshots.

* `Inv` opens your inventory or the creative interface.

* `Esc` opens the pause menu and goes back menus. 

* `Fullscreen`, of F11, toggles fullscreen feature.
